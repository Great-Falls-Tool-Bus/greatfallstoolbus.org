# `preview-tailnet:_house-hydrate` pair is dormant here — PR #225 inlined the
# hydrate step into the ratified `preview-tailnet` lane, whose only recipe
# callee is the unguarded `db-migrate` operator lane. If the lane ever grows
# a guarded callee again, add its "<lane>:<recipe>" pair here; the lane
